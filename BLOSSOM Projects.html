			<h3>A timeline of important milestones for my work.<h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>April 21st, 2020 - The Response to COVID-19: Proof of Potential</dt>
				<dd>At the height of the first lockdown, I publish my first public work: an optimistic contribution to our student hall's newspaper.</dd>
				<dt>May 24th, 2021 - Day 45: Deadline for Samoa</dt>
				<dd>After a year of steady NZ & US current events coverage in my personal blog, "Frozen Peaches", I branch out with the first piece I'm truly proud of, covering an attempted soft-coup in Samoa.</dd>
				<dt>June 18th, 2021 - The Luminaries (Eleanor Catton)</dt>
				<dd>I try my hand at something different - a book review. While the format peters out after a little while, it augurs my future interest in publicly discussing fiction, not just reality.</dd>
				<dt>September 12th, 2021 - Ground Zero Graveyard</dt>
				<dd>Frozen Peaches had, up until this point, mostly featured quick articles of five hundred to a thousand words. GZG, commemorating the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, was the first step towards the blog's future as a long-form content outlet, consistently hitting several thousand words of analysis.</dd>
				<dt>November 4th, 2021 - Succession: A Labour Party Drama, coming to HBO</dt>
				<dd>In probably my proudest moment of forecasting, I successfully predict the circumstances of Prime Minister Jacinda's resignation fifteen months ahead of time. My confidence in my ability to analyse facts is building.</dd>
				<dt>May 12th, 2023 - A Night In The Club With Christopher Luxon</dt>
				<dd>I do my first piece of in-person amateur journalism, attending a speech given by the future Prime Minister; during this election, I also write on my time spent with the leader of the Opportunities Party, the future Deputy Prime Minister, and the future Minister of Housing.</dd>
				<dt>August 23rd, 2023 - https://twitter.com/frozen_peaches</dt>
				<dd>I launch my first foray into multimedia production, providing instant live commentary on major election debates.</dd>
				<dt>October 13rd, 2023 - Predictions For Every Electorate and Party Vote Result and MPs in the Next Parliament. Yes, Every.</dt>
				<dd>In another breakthrough moment for my confidence, I both try my hand in another new format - a data table - and am able to use my willingness to comprehensively catalogue information to produce something of uniquely high quality and detail.</dd>
				<dt>March 30th, 2024 - Welcome to the Hitchhiker's Guide to Politics in Debating: Part One!</dt>
				<dd>On the heels of the complex and flawed Riding the Ouroboros, this represents a turning point for the blog where I unsuccessfully attempt multiple running series - two months later, the Weekly Defrost starts, which does not outlast the 2024 presidential election. My focus in what I want to do has begun to shift.</dt>
				<dt>August 13th, 2024 - When Game of Thrones Passed the Point of No Return</dt>
				<dd>This is my new choice of direction: to develop skills in video editing, a previously unfamiliar field to me. "spoiler I hardly" is online, and its first video might be long and troubled, soon to be struck down by automated copyright protections, but it's also an invaluable learning experience.</dt>
				<dt>October 28th, 2024 - Lord of the Firelights: The Arcane Character Study</dt>
				<dd>The second video on spoiler i hardly is a breakthrough in style and analysis - proof of concept that I can produce quality videos of reasonable length in a reasonable amount of time.</dt>
				<dt>May 4th, 2025 - From A Certain Point of View: Ranking Forty Star Wars Stories</dt>
				<dd>After a bumpy road with the channel's third and fourth videos, FACPOV nails the formula - thirty minutes of entertaining, thoughtful reviewing of a story collection, made in just a month.</dt>
				<dt>September 17th, 2025 - Only One Tells The Truth: How Undertale Lies, and Keeps Its Promises</dt>
				<dd>The channel finally produces a video that cracks three digit views - a worthwile audience for the amount of time spent on this behemothic commemoration of Undertale's tenth anniversary.</dt>
				<dt>October 2nd, 2025 - An Interview with Xavier Dickason, City Council Candidate for Fendalton</dt>
				<dd>In another new frontier for me, instead of just taking notes on candidates' speeches, I actually prepare an hour's worth of questions and conduct a one-on-one interview in person.</dd>
				<dt>October 15th, 2025 - A Perfect Āwhā
				<dd>After five continuous years of posting my practice, often uncomfortable and stilted pieces of writing, I at long last feel that I have reached the high standard of writing I expect from myself. This piece is everything that, at this time, I could hope to achieve with a keyboard, the Internet and my wits in response to fast-moving events. Frozen Peaches may not update often anymore, but its quality is guaranteed.
				<dt>October 31st, 2025 - trailer I hardly</dt>
				<dd>And, in conjunction with this very website breaching a brand new frontier for me in website design, I finally commit myself to a firm video-a-month schedule for the next seven. It's an unusually bold move for me, and represents total confidence that I have mastered my non-fiction writing on Frozen Peaches and see the next step as getting the hang of multidimensional fiction analysis.</dt>
				<hr>
				<dt>November 20th, 2025 - Star Wars's Red Wedding</dt>
				<dd>My first video of this newly announced schedule is a response to the stunning success of Season Two of the television show Andor earlier in the year.</dd>
				<dt>December 11th, 2025 - Breaking The Amazing Digital Cir-Curse</dt>
				<dd>I will push myself to draw ties between a variety of very different pieces of media to reach some universal conclusions about storytelling and how it relates to us.</dd>
				<dt>January 15th, 2026 - The Wolf and the Lion: The Tipping Point for Game of Thrones</dt>
				<dd>In my only public redux of my work ever, I intend to repair the copyright issues with my first video and republish it at a far higher level than it ever was before.</dd>
				<dt>February 12th, 2026 - Secret Trailer</dt>
				<dd>I'll present another example of my short-form editing skills developing, and make some new commitments for the new year.</dd>
				<dt>March 12th: Undertale? More Like Underfail: The Bad Route</dt>
				<dd>I have some addendums in mind to my video praising Undertale; even-handed criticism can be doled out, too.</dd>
				<dt>April 1st, 2026: Seven Deltarune Theories</dt>
				<dd>More high-quality analysis is in store.</dd>
				<dt>May 4th, 2026: From A Certain Point Of View: The Empire Strikes Back</dt>
				<dd>If reviewing the Star Wars Fortieth Anniversary Book went so well...well then, why not commemorate the anniversary of that video by reviewing its sequel?</dd>
				<dt>May-November 2026: Election Coverage</dt>
				<dd>For the third election running, Frozen Peaches will provide up-to-date coverage on what's important in the news, and to you, the voter.</dd>
				<dt>???, 2026: - who knows?</dt>
				<dd>I have a lot of ideas of what's in store next. I can promise that four videos will be coming out in the next seven months after I end my current run. Drop a subscribe on spoiler i hardly, and wait and see.</dd>
				<dt>???, ??? - ???</dt>
				<dd>A lot of ideas.</dd>
